# `üèÜ The Complete Competitive Programming  Preparation üèÜ`

The Repository contains the solution for the competitive programming questions and contest on various platforms. like Codechef, CodeForces, Leetcode & also solutions of the Hiring Challennges conducted by different companies like Google, Juspay, Microsoft!

***Before dive into this repo you should know why do we need these concepts. What is Role of [DSA in your real life](https://mrpawan-gupta.medium.com/role-of-data-structures-algorithms-for-software-engineer-a6b1ea5a8701)??***


‚Äú For solving any real-world problem with programming approach we need to follow some steps & strategy. The collection of that steps is Algorithm, whereas a data structure is a way to store and organize data during solving that problem or constructing any software so that it can be used efficiently in terms of time and space, this way Data structure & Algorithms always allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.‚Äù


* ***STL*** is standard template library, It is most powerful & useful while doing competitive coding questions [Read More]((https://github.com/mrpawan-gupta/DSA-inNout/tree/main/Resources/Cpp/CPP-STL)).
